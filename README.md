Minor Projects + Major Project | SME Security, Zero Trust Architecture & Phishing Simulation

This repository contains three cybersecurity-focused academic projects designed to improve security awareness, demonstrate real-world security models, and provide hands-on cyber defense concepts.

Projects included:
Minor Project 1 – Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for SMEs
Minor Project 2 – Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) Security Tool
Major Project – Phishing Awareness Simulation Using Social Engineering

Minor Project 1: SME Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
A NIST-based framework to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks for SMEs.
Key Points
Common risks: phishing, ransomware, weak passwords, cloud misconfigurations
NIST CSF: Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover
Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact
Mitigation: MFA, patching, segmentation, training, backups

Case Study Highlights
Retail: MFA + segmentation → fewer unauthorized access attempts
IT: IAM + logging → stronger cloud security
Manufacturing: backups → quick recovery


Minor Project 2: Zero Trust Architecture Tool
Implements “Never Trust, Always Verify” with a simple password-security checker.
Features
Checks password strength (length, symbols, patterns)
Optional email check (demo only)
Gives recommendations for stronger passwords
Notes
Educational only (not a real authentication system)


Major Project: Phishing Awareness Simulation
Controlled simulation to study how users react to phishing attacks.
Results
5 participants
4 clicked the link (80% click rate)
3 tried entering data (60% victim rate)
0 reported the email

Findings
Urgency increases click-through rates
Awareness levels strongly influence behavior
Prevention
MFA, spam filters, DNS filtering
URL checking habits, training, reporting culture


Conclusion
These projects demonstrate:
SME risk assessment using structured frameworks
Zero Trust authentication concepts
Real-world phishing behavior and awareness improvement
All projects aim to build better cybersecurity hygiene and awareness.
